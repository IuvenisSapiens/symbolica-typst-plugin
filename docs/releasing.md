# Releasing to Typst Universe

Symbolica 0.1.0 is already published. The next release needs a new version;
do not create a new `v0.1.0` tag pointing to today's source or replace that
version in the package registry.

The [release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) adapts the
[Typst community template](https://github.com/typst-community/typst-package-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)
to build the Wasm plugin and check its documentation before distributing it.
It does not publish the Rust crate to crates.io.

## Prepare a version

Update `typst.toml` and the package imports in both READMEs and Typst examples.
Update the version in the README's local installation path as well.
Record the changes in `CHANGELOG.md`, regenerate the manual with
`nix run .#manual`, and commit the result. The Rust crate's version can advance
separately from the Typst package version.

`README.md` describes the repository and development workflow.
`README-universe.md` is the package documentation; packaging copies it to
`README.md` in the submission. Its examples must use the release version and
compile with the staged package. Relative links to the
manual and examples are retained: those files belong in the registry submission
even though `typst.toml` excludes them from runtime downloads.

## Dry run

Choose **Prepare and release Typst package → Run workflow** in GitHub Actions.
This builds, tests, and uploads artifacts only. It does not create a GitHub
release or push a submission branch, even if run against a tag. A dry run can
use the current manifest version while preparing an update to an already
published package.

The workflow tests the reusable library and plugin, rebuilds Wasm, checks the
examples and committed manual, and compiles the release README snippets against
the staged package. It uploads:

- `symbolica-VERSION.tar.gz`: the runtime package.
- `symbolica-VERSION-universe.tar.gz`: the complete registry submission,
  including README-linked documentation under `packages/preview/symbolica/VERSION`.
- `symbolica-VERSION-source.tar.gz`: matching source and vendored dependencies.
- `symbolica-VERSION-manual.pdf` and `SHA256SUMS`.

`SOURCE.json` inside the package identifies the source revision and checksums
for the Wasm and dependency lockfile. Inspect the artifacts before tagging.
Artifact retention is 30 days; actual releases retain their downloadable assets.

For a local metadata check, run:

```sh
nix develop -c python3 scripts/release.py preflight
```

## Publish a new version

Push a `vVERSION` tag matching the committed `typst.toml`. The workflow rejects
mismatched tags, outdated package imports, and versions already present in
`typst/packages`. A registry lookup failure also stops publication.

After validation, it creates a GitHub release containing the same artifacts.
The corresponding source revision must remain publicly accessible.

The workflow prepares `release/symbolica-VERSION` with the package under
`packages/preview/symbolica/VERSION`. Configure a registry fork to push a branch
based on current `typst/packages:main` directly to that fork. Without this
configuration, it creates the branch here, based on the released source, using
the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Both paths refuse to overwrite an existing branch.

## Configure the registry fork

The first release used [`benruijl/packages`](https://github.com/benruijl/packages),
a fork of `typst/packages`. To reuse it:

1. As `benruijl`, create a fine-grained personal access token with resource
   owner `benruijl`, **Only select repositories → packages**, and repository
   permission **Contents → Read and write**. Set an expiration date.
2. In `symbolica-dev/symbolica-typst-plugin`, open **Settings → Secrets and
   variables → Actions**. Add a repository secret named `REGISTRY_TOKEN`
   containing the token, and a repository variable named `REGISTRY_FORK`
   containing `benruijl/packages`.

Store the token directly in Actions secrets. It does not belong in source files
or chat. Renew it before its expiration date.

The fork owner creates this token: GitHub currently does not support
fine-grained tokens for writing to another user's repository as a collaborator.
See [GitHub's token documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-limitations).
For local pushes as `lcnbr`, Ben can also invite `lcnbr` as a collaborator on
`benruijl/packages`; this is separate from the workflow's token.

The workflow checks out only `packages/preview/symbolica` from current upstream
`main`, adds the new version, and pushes the submission branch to the fork.
There is no need to sync the fork's `main` first. Its job summary links to the
comparison page for opening the PR. Dry runs never push either kind of branch.

## Submit to Typst packages

With a registry fork configured, open the PR using the link in the workflow's
job summary. GitHub requires its source branch to be in `typst/packages` or one
of its forks.

Without that configuration, copy the prepared files from this repository's
submission branch into your fork as follows.

In a clean clone of that fork, replace `VERSION` below with the released version:

```sh
git fetch https://github.com/typst/packages.git main
git switch -c release/symbolica-VERSION FETCH_HEAD
git fetch https://github.com/symbolica-dev/symbolica-typst-plugin.git release/symbolica-VERSION
git restore --source=FETCH_HEAD -- packages/preview/symbolica/VERSION
git add packages/preview/symbolica/VERSION
git commit -m 'symbolica:VERSION'
git push -u origin HEAD
```

This copies only the package directory into the registry history. You can also
extract the GitHub release's `symbolica-VERSION-universe.tar.gz` into your fork
instead of fetching the submission branch. Use your usual GitHub credentials
for the push; they do not need to be stored in this repository's Actions secrets.

Open and review the PR against `typst/packages:main`. Universe
publication occurs after the registry maintainers merge the PR and its
deployment completes; creating the GitHub release alone does not publish to
Universe. See the [registry submission instructions](https://github.com/typst/packages/blob/main/docs/README.md).
